# binary_gan_demo

This demonstrates a binary GAN pre-trained on CelebA, where the prior p(z) is a Bernoulli(0.5) scaled so that its values are either -1 or +1.

Download the model file from [here](https://mega.nz/#!sP5TmQgL!G3t_928bR3uQRmjETOHfK_xAjISKPYJ61iGvedkL7A4) and place it in the `models/` folder. The run an IPython notebook server to run `widgets.ipynb`.
